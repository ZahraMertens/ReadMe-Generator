## Contribution-Guidelines

Prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted. For Git commit messages use only present tense and commit any little change to make debugging easier. When committing content use emojis which describe the kind of work the most to make it easier t track the changes.

## Test Instructions
To run tests, you need to run the following command:

Just example content: "Assert statements typically allow to define messages which are shown if the test fails. You should provide here meaningful messages to make it easier for the user to identify and fix the problem. This is especially true if someone looks at the problem, who did not write the code under test or the test code."
